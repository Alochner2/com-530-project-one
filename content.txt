Amber Lochner: Background and Ambitions

Hi All! Iâ€™m a graduate student going back into higher education for a
career change. As much as I enjoy administrative assistant roles, I am ready to
expand my skill sets and explore the world of UX/UI design.

Currently, I am taking human computer interaction and web design. My hope for
this class is to come away with a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
In addition, I would also like to have a better eye for the aesthetic portion of
design. My goal is to create websites and apps that are not only user-friendly,
but also an enjoyable experience.

Being a well rounded designer is my ultimate ambition. Learning design software,
building things through front-end and back-end development, and researching what
users want and need are all a part of the process to get me there. Thanks for
stopping by!
